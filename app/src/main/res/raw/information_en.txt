-1|<p>The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8 percent of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — about one million Earths could fit inside the sun.</p><p>The visible part of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius), while temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F (15 million C), driven by nuclear reactions. One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by the sun, according to NASA.</p><p>The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years from the galactic core, completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. The sun is relatively young, part of a generation of stars known as Population I, which are relatively rich in elements heavier than helium. An older generation of stars is called Population II, and an earlier generation of Population III may have existed, although no members of this generation are known yet.</p>
-2|<p>The moon is the easiest celestial object to find in the night sky — when it's there. Earth's only natural satellite hovers above us bright and round until it seemingly disappears for a few nights. The rhythm of the moon's phases has guided humanity for millennia — for instance, calendar months are roughly equal to the time it takes to go from one full moon to the next.</p><p>Moon phases and the moon's orbit are mysteries to many. For example, the moon always shows us the same face. That happens because it takes 27.3 days both to rotate on its axis and to orbit Earth. We see either the full moon, half moon or no moon (new moon) because the moon reflects sunlight. How much of it we see depends on the moon's position in relation to Earth and the sun.</p><p>Though a satellite of Earth, the moon, with a diameter of about 2,159 miles (3,475 kilometers), is bigger than Pluto. (Four other moons in our solar system are even bigger.) The moon is a bit more than one-fourth (27 percent) the size of Earth, a much smaller ratio (1:4) than any other planets and their moons. This means the moon has a great effect on the planet and very possibly is what makes life on Earth possible.</p><ul><li>Average distance from Earth: 238,855 miles (384,400 km)</li><li>Perigee (closest approach to Earth): 225,700 miles (363,300 km)</li><li>Apogee (farthest distance from Earth): 252,000 miles (405,500 km)</li><li>Orbit circumference: 1,499,618.58 miles (2,413,402 km)</li><li>Mean orbit velocity: 2,287 mph (3,680.5 km/h)</li></ul>
-3|<p>The fourth planet from the sun, is a cold, dusty place. The dust, an iron oxide, gives the planet its reddish cast. Mars shares similarities with Earth: It is rocky, has mountains and valleys, and storm systems ranging from localized tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms. It snows on Mars. And Mars harbors water ice. Scientists think it was once wet and warm, though today it’s cold and desert-like.</p><p>Mars' atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist on the surface for any length of time. Scientists think ancient Mars would have had the conditions to support life, and there is hope that signs of past life — possibly even present biology — may exist on the Red Planet.</p><ul><li>Discovery: Known to the ancients and visible to the naked eye</li><li>Named for: Roman god of war</li><li>Diameter: 4,217 miles (6,787 km)</li><li>Orbit: 687 Earth days</li><li>Day: Just more than one Earth day (24 hours, 37 minutes)</li></ul>
-4|<p>The closest planet to the sun, Mercury is only a bit larger than Earth's moon. Its day side is scorched by the sun and can reach 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 Celsius), but on the night side, temperatures drop to hundreds of degrees below freezing. Mercury has virtually no atmosphere to absorb meteor impacts, so its surface is pockmarked with craters, just like the moon. Over its four-year mission, NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft has revealed views of the planet that have challenged astronomers' expectations.</p><ul><li>Discovery: Known to the ancients and visible to the naked eye</li><li>Named for: Messenger of the Roman gods</li><li>Diameter: 3,031 miles (4,878 km)</li><li>Orbit: 88 Earth days</li><li>Day: 58.6 Earth days</li></ul>
-5|<p>The second planet from the sun, Venus is terribly hot, even hotter than Mercury. The atmosphere is toxic. The pressure at the surface would crush and kill you. Scientists describe Venus’ situation as a runaway greenhouse effect. Its size and structure are similar to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway "greenhouse effect." Oddly, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p><p>The Greeks believed Venus was two different objects — one in the morning sky and another in the evening. Because it is often brighter than any other object in the sky — except for the sun and moon — Venus has generated many UFO reports.</p><ul><li>Discovery: Known to the ancients and visible to the naked eye</li><li>Named for: Roman goddess of love and beauty</li><li>Diameter: 7,521 miles (12,104 km)</li><li>Orbit: 225 Earth days</li><li>Day: 241 Earth days</li></ul>
-6|<p>The fifth planet from the sun, Jupiter is huge and is the most massive planet in our solar system. It’s a mostly gaseous world, mostly hydrogen and helium. Its swirling clouds are colorful due to different types of trace gases. A big feature is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm which has raged for hundreds of years. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, and with dozens of moons, it looks a bit like a miniature solar system.</p><ul><li>Discovery: Known to the ancients and visible to the naked eye</li><li>Named for: Ruler of the Roman gods</li><li>Diameter: 86,881 miles (139,822 km)</li><li>Orbit: 11.9 Earth years</li><li>Day: 9.8 Earth hours</li></ul>
-7|<p>The sixth planet from the sun is known most for its rings. When Galileo Galilei first studied Saturn in the early 1600s, he thought it was an object with three parts. Not knowing he was seeing a planet with rings, the stumped astronomer entered a small drawing — a symbol with one large circle and two smaller ones — in his notebook, as a noun in a sentence describing his discovery. More than 40 years later, Christiaan Huygens proposed that they were rings. The rings are made of ice and rock. Scientists are not yet sure how they formed. The gaseous planet is mostly hydrogen and helium. It has numerous moons.</p><ul><li>Discovery: Known to the ancients and visible to the naked eye</li><li>Named for: Roman god of agriculture</li><li>Diameter: 74,900 miles (120,500 km)</li><li>Orbit: 29.5 Earth years</li><li>Day: About 10.5 Earth hours</li></ul>
-8|<p>The seventh planet from the sun, Uranus is an oddball. It’s the only giant planet whose equator is nearly at right angles to its orbit — it basically orbits on its side. Astronomers think the planet collided with some other planet-size object long ago, causing the tilt. The tilt causes extreme seasons that last 20-plus years, and the sun beats down on one pole or the other for 84 Earth-years. Uranus is about the same size as Neptune. Methane in the atmosphere gives Uranus its blue-green tint. It has numerous moons and faint rings.</p><ul><li>Discovery: 1781 by William Herschel (was thought previously to be a star)</li><li>Named for: Personification of heaven in ancient myth</li><li>Diameter: 31,763 miles (51,120 km)</li><li>Orbit: 84 Earth years</li><li>Day: 18 Earth hours</li></ul>
-9|<p>The eighth planet from the sun, Neptune is known for strong winds — sometimes faster than the speed of sound. Neptune is far out and cold. The planet is more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth. It has a rocky core. Neptune was the first planet to be predicted to exist by using math, before it was detected. Irregularities in the orbit of Uranus led French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to suggest some other might be exerting a gravitational tug. German astronomer Johann Galle used calculations to help find Neptune in a telescope. Neptune is about 17 times as massive as Earth.</p><ul><li>Discovery: 1846</li><li>Named for: Roman god of water</li><li>Diameter: 30,775 miles (49,530 km)</li><li>Orbit: 165 Earth years</li><li>Day: 19 Earth hours</li></ul>
-10|<p>Once the ninth planet from the sun, Pluto is unlike other planets in many respects. It is smaller than Earth's moon. Its orbit carries it inside the orbit of Neptune and then way out beyond that orbit. From 1979 until early 1999, Pluto had actually been the eighth planet from the sun. Then, on Feb. 11, 1999, it crossed Neptune's path and once again became the solar system's most distant planet — until it was demoted to dwarf planet status. Pluto will stay beyond Neptune for 228 years. Pluto’s orbit is tilted to the main plane of the solar system — where the other planets orbit — by 17.1 degrees. It’s a cold, rocky world with only a very ephemeral atmosphere. NASA's New Horizons mission performed history's first flyby of the Pluto system on July 14, 2015.</p><ul><li>Discovery: 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh</li><li>Named for: Roman god of the underworld, Hades</li><li>Diameter: 1,430 miles (2,301 km)</li><li>Orbit: 248 Earth years</li><li>Day: 6.4 Earth day</li></ul>
-11|<p>Polaris is located at a distance of 434 light-years from Earth and has luminosity nearly 4,000 times that of our sun. Polaris shines at 2nd magnitude. On this astronomers' scale, smaller numbers represent brighter objects, with the brightest stars and planets in the night sky at around magnitude zero or even negative magnitudes.</p><p>The North Star it is a "pulsing" star, a Cepheid variable, which appears to vary in brightness ever so slightly – only one tenth of a magnitude – over a time frame of just under four days.</p><p>Exactly where you see Polaris in your northern sky depends on your latitude.  From New York it stands 41 degrees above the northern horizon, which also corresponds to the latitude of New York.  Since 10 degrees is roughly equal to your clenched fist held at arm's length, from New York Polaris would appear to stand about "four fists" above the northern horizon.  At the North Pole, you would find it overhead.  At the equator, Polaris would appear to sit right on the horizon.  So if you travel to the north, the North Star climbs progressively higher the farther north you go.  When you head south, the star drops lower and ultimately disappears once you cross the equator and head into the Southern Hemisphere.</p><p>Always keep this fact in mind: Polaris is more accurate than any compass.  A compass is subject to periodic variations and can only show you the direction of the lines of the strongest magnetic force for a particular spot and for a particular time. But even Polaris isn't positioned exactly due north.  Only about 0.7 degree separates Polaris from the pivot point directly in the north – called the North Celestial Pole – around which the stars go daily. In case you're wondering, 0.7 degree amounts to less than the apparent width of 1½ full moons.</p>
25544|<p><p>Zarya (Dawn) is the Russian-built, American-financed module that was the first-launched of numerous planned modules of the International Space Station (ISS), which is being assembled in earth orbit. The ISS orbit is approximately circular at 386 km, with an inclination of 52.6 degrees. Zarya, the initial control module, also known as the Functional Cargo Block (FGM when the Russian equivalent acronym is transliterated), was linked together with Unity, the American six-port habitable connection module, in the first assembly step of the ISS. Because Zarya was the first-orbited element of the ISS, its international spacecraft ID (1998-067A) will also be the ID used for the International Space Station, and the continually-evolving brief description of the ISS will also be maintained here. References to other information are given at the end of this description.<\/p><p>The International Space Station is a large multi-module earth-orbiting space station, intended to be a long-term manned station for various research and development uses. It will be constructed in earth orbit, using STS shuttle flights (U.S.A.) and Proton and Soyuz rocket flights (Russia) for ferrying components into orbit and for later resupply flights.<\/p><p>In 1984, President Ronald Reagan gave NASA the go-ahead to build a space station, and invited the participation of international partners. There was a series of proposed plans for a large manned earth-orbiting space station, at low inclination, to be coordinated with related platforms, such as the ESA Columbus Polar Platform, Columbus Attached Lab, and Columbus Free-flying Platform. Over time, each proposed station and alternative version in turn failed to gain acceptance and budget approval, and was dropped during re-scoping and down-sizing of the plan. Those rejected items included Space Station Alpha and Space Station Freedom, the last of the group. The ESA Columbus platforms underwent a similar re-scoping and down-sizing, and the principal ESA module will be the laboratory Columbus Orbital Facility (COF), to be flown after the year 2002.<\/p><p>Eventually the multi-nation US-led international station, named International Space Station, or ISS, was accepted and gained U.S. budget approval. By launch time the mission had evolved, due largely to financial constraints, to include a variety of levels of involvement by additional other nations. As of November, 1998 the global participants, in addition to the United States, included Russia, Canada, Japan, Brazil, and ESA (Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland).<\/p><p>In the first phase of the project, seven U.S. astronauts spent almost 27 months aboard the Russian Mir, gaining technical, operational and risk management experience. In the next phase (November 1998 - January 2000) the station will expand from its first two sections to include labs, larger solar wings, a Soyuz return vehicle, communications systems and a robot arm. After that (March 2000 - January 2004), labs from Japan and ESA will be added, as well as a centrifuge module for experiments requiring gravity, and finally a U.S.-built habitation module big enough for a permanent crew of seven.<\/p><p>Once the station becomes habitable, perhaps early in 2000, three-person crews will begin living aboard and conducting long-term experiments. Anticipated projects for ISS include zero-gravity research in processing of materials and pharmaceuticals, and biological research.<\/p><p>The first two modules of the ISS, Zarya (1998-067A) and Unity (1998-069F, also called Node 1), were attached together in orbit at 02:49 GMT on December 7, 1998. Zarya, a 43,000-pound (~19,500 kg) control module launched November 20 by a Russian Proton rocket, and Unity, a 25,500-pound (~11,600 kg) six-port habitable connection module launched aboard the U.S. STS-88 Space Shuttle on December 3, were linked together by the international crew of STS-88. With the subsequent connection of various power, communication, and data cables, the International Space Station became operational.
